Mr Speaker-elect, I think you are eminently qualified for this job---for a start, you are a lawyer; a very successful one, with long parliamentary experience.

       "163   Well, it is impossible because the House has not been sitting. The Standing Order contemplates a year in which we have a normal year's sitting, through to the end of the year; we would have a third sitting day in the preceding December, and we would plan the next year's sitting programme around that particular year. \\n     It cannot be that a Standing Order can be drafted in such a way as to conflict with a decision of the House to adjourn, which is a perfectly legitimate decision for the H...   \n",
       "164   I suggest to you, Mr Speaker, that the issue is whether the Government actually is required to move to suspend the Standing Orders in order to put the adjournment motion. The point made by my colleague Mr Hunt---[Interruption] Has the member got some indigestion problem? The point made by my colleague Mr Hunt is that this motion itself automatically breaches Standing Order 80. We are being asked to say we will not have a third sitting day in December. That is a very good reason for voting f...   \n",
       "165   Further to the point of order, I point out that I raised a specific question to which I would like a specific answer. I understand that if the amendment is passed there is no problem. But it is 13 December today. Technically the House can sit every day, except Sundays, until 24 December. I would certainly vote for any motion to have this matter considered on a subsequent sitting day. But I want to know whether the Standing Order does apply.

       "354                                        The answer to that question is very obvious. It lies in the coalition agreement, which was signed between National and New Zealand First, and above all in the expectation that New Zealanders will play their full role, each one individually and collectively, in long- term recovery for this country. Economic stability and interest rates at the appropriate level are all affected not just by the Government but by business and individual New Zealanders as well.    \n",

Helen Clark was rising to move the debate that you have just permitted, but Standing Order 385 states very explicitly that in announcing that a debate has been allowed the Speaker reads the written statement to the House and calls on the member who submitted the statement to move the motion. Mike Moore was here until he was ordered to leave the House by Helen Clark a few moments ago. He was outside the Chamber speaking to a colleague a few minutes ago. What we have...   \n",

I have read thoroughly the papers that were tabled recently, which purported to show or demonstrate the authorisation for \\n    18 February 1997 \\n  \\n  \\n    the clothing expenditure associated with Aotearoa Television.

      "     JOHN BLINCOE (Nelson): I join my colleague from Dunedin North in welcoming the introduction of the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Bill. I have to say, though, that we have been waiting for the Bill to be introduced for an extraordinarily long time. There have been incredible delays. In fact, this legislation has come before the House more than 5 years after the Labour Government introduced some legislation that related to hazardous substances---namely, Part XIII of the Resource Management Bill, which was introduced in 1989. \n",

Sir Geoffrey Palmer, took the view that the issue was so urgent that we oug\n",

      "     I thought that the Government needed a bit of encouragement in this regard, so I introduced a private member's Bill in June 1993 to do what the Government was not prepared to do and to commence the part of the Resource Management Act that would bring in the hazards control commission---which by then had changed its name to the Environmental Risk Management Authority. I was happy to adopt that, and I did. My Bill aimed to bring that into effect and, to the Government's credit, it did not oppose the introduction of the Bill. \n",

There is nothing in the existing GATT or World Trade Organisation agreements that reduces New Zealand's ability to determine its own standards of protection. That is the key. Many people who have reservations about this legislation have not understood the principles involved. The trade effects of the measures may be significant. However, there are things that we in New Zealand are very concerned about. New Zealand bans or restricts the importation of certain products that are a threat to human and animal health. That is acceptable under the current GATT agreement, on the basis that such measures have a sound, scientific basis. What we do not want is, as I mentioned earlier, any sort of flaky concern that is used as, effectively, a trade barrier against New Zealand.

I instance the system of education in this country, not because I want to divert attention away from the issues that the member for Waitakere has been talking about, but because if we change the education system---more to the point, if we increase to the maximum the number of students in this country who are exposed to education, formal and informal---then in my view, in the long term, we may well do as much to change perceptions about international issues like the environment as we can do in any other way. It might seem a roundabout route; it might seem quite peripheral in the short term; but in the long term it may be one of the major ways in which we change people's perception and behaviour. \n",

      "    the convention was adopted as far back as 1982, at which time New Zealand was in the forefront, and it decided to sign at that stage. When we look at the implications of the Bill, we see that the convention established a comprehensive framework throughout the world for the governing of the limits of the national jurisdiction over ocean space, and when we appreciate that New Zealand is very much a country that is surrounded by the sea, it is very important for us as a country to make sure that certain limitations and jurisdict\n",

Fines have ranged between, I think, $500 and $9,000. Quite frankly, many developers simply regard this sort of level of fine as a licence fee to be vandals.

In the 10 years that they took to develop, it has become an oasis of native bush in an area that has long since been denuded of its natural cover. In March of this year the trees were about 2 metres in height. I had the occasion to look through the trees, and it really was a beautiful area. \n",

The committee came back with the declared desire in the commentary to strengthen that clause by putting in the phrase ``shall act in a manner consistent with'' and says that its recommendation reflects this proposal. I ask a question about the kind of precedent that this will give rise to, and I ask that because the question has arisen in another select committee about the status of commentary to Bills when they are reported back. Will it be that as select committees try to---quite rightly---give very clear reasons for making their decisions, commentaries will play some part in the interpretation of Acts of Parliament in the courts at some stage in the future?

While tipping and landfill processes are much better than they used to be, large areas of land are still not available for many other purposes---and land is becoming a scarce commodity in many of our cities and districts.

       "36    Thank you very much. \\n     The plain fact is that in October 1992 the House debated the Sealord Products deal. On numerous occasions the then Deputy Speaker sought to circumvent the Standing Orders and Speakers' rulings. He knew that he was wrong, and he stuck to his guns knowing full well that he was wrong. Members should read the Hansard. The Deputy Speaker concluded with a wrong ruling, by evicting a member from the House on that occasion. That is no cause for confidence on our part. \\n...   \n",
