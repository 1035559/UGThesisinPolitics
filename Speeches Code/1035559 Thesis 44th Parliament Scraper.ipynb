       "405   Direct measures of production equipment imported by manufacturers are not readily available, but historically over 50 percent of manufactured investment is sourced from imports. In the year ended September 1993 manufacturing investment grew by 29.5 percent to reach $1.68 billion. A large amount of that will have come from the $3.9 billion of capital goods imported for the same period. The implications are positive for the manufacturing sector. The recent investment increases confirm the str...   \n",

The survey did not reveal any breaches of the 1991 Education Amendment Act (No. 4). Under the old legislation we found discrimination on the basis of wealth. If people could afford to buy a home in the zone of one of the sought-after schools, they were lucky. If people were not as wealthy as that, they were just unlucky.    \n",

Over 8,000 of those people are of Pacific Island origin; Of the total, about 58 percent of overstayers and about 53 percent of those people who have been removed from New Zealand are Pacific Islanders.

I seek the leave of the House for questions to go on through to question No. 12 to allow those two new members to ask them. I am not suggesting that we will continue with this practice.    \n",

       "36    Thank you very much. \\n     The plain fact is that in October 1992 the House debated the Sealord Products deal. On numerous occasions the then Deputy Speaker sought to circumvent the Standing Orders and Speakers' rulings. He knew that he was wrong, and he stuck to his guns knowing full well that he was wrong. Members should read the Hansard. The Deputy Speaker concluded with a wrong ruling, by evicting a member from the House on that occasion. That is no cause for confidence on our part. \\n...   \n",
